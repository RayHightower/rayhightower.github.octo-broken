    <updated>2014-12-31T16:18:29-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/31/looking-inside-pygments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog uses <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/pygments.rb">pygments.rb</a> for syntax highlighting. Recently <code>pygments.rb</code> stopped working, so I had to dig inside to determine the problem and apply a solution.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: Pygments didn&rsquo;t simply stop working. I applied updates related to Octopress and Lunr.js, and then it stopped working. So the root cause is me! Rather than back-out the updates, I decided to push forward because Lunr.js will improve the search experience for visitors. Search options will be discussed in a future post.</p>

<h3>Starting With the Error Message</h3>

<p>As with all <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> based blogs, the <code>$ rake generate</code> command creates a new set of static pages every time the command gets run. Normally the process is smooth. Here&rsquo;s the error message that resulted this morning.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>rake generate

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What unknown language? Something was fishy. Fortunately, <code>pygments</code> is an open source plugin. Solving the problem was non-trivial, but doable.</p>

<h3>Exploring Pygments Internals</h3>

<p>Google, Stack Overflow, and the Octopress documentation gave clues on where to explore. Adding a few lines to <code>source/plugins/pygments_code.rb</code> provided insights on what <code>pygments</code> was &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Observing the Results, Applying a Solution</h3>

<p>Next step: Run <code>$ rake generate</code> and see what happens. Turns out that the lastest version of <code>pygments</code> halted for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of my older blog posts did not contain a space between the triple-backtick characters and the name of the language being highlighted. Earlier versions of <code>pygments</code> did not care, but the current version is a stickler.</li>
<li><code>pygments</code> appears to want a blank line between any triple-backtick line and any other text in the blog post.</li>
</ul>


<p>Vim-fu allowed me to apply solutions with minimal manual work. And now <code>pygments</code> works well.</p>

<p>On to search, to be discussed in a future blog post.</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/30/owc-thinks-ahead</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/owc_ssd.jpg' width='' height='' alt='MacBook Pro SSD, next to a nickel.' title='MacBook Pro SSD, next to a nickel.'><span class='caption-text'>MacBook Pro SSD, next to a nickel.</span></span>
Every computer user has to deal with this at some point. Your machine runs out of storage space: hard drive, SSD, or whatever mass storage you happen to use. In my case, the 512GB SSD in my early 2013 MacBook Pro was over 90% full. Time for an upgrade.</p>

<p>Fortunately (and contrary to what the Apple literature says) it is possible to upgrade the SSD in a MacBook Pro. RAM is different because the MBP&rsquo;s RAM is soldered to the logic board. But the SSD plugs into a socket. The SSD upgrade path is well-documented on YouTube and elsewhere.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Ordered from OWC</h3>

<p>Ordering an SSD from Amazon would have saved a few bucks, but I chose <a href="https://www.macsales.com/">Other World Computing</a> instead. Past experience with OWC has been outstanding. The company consistently offers high-performance gear. It was all a matter of trust.</p>

<p>On the day my 960GB SSD arrived, I smacked myself on the forehead. I realized (too late) that I forgot to order a screwdriver for the special pentalobe screws that hold the MacBook Pro together.</p>

<h3>Screwdrivers Included</h3>

<p>But&hellip; When I opened the SSD box from OWC, I was pleasantly surprised. A pentalobe screwdriver was included in the SSD kit, along with a six-point Torx screwdriver. Both screwdrivers are needed for the installation. Thanks to OWC’s forethought, my upgrade plans moved forward undisturbed.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the SSD upgrade was waiting <em>patiently</em> for the Time Machine restoration to complete.</p>

<p>OWC thinks ahead.</p>

<h3>Lesson Learned</h3>

<p><a href="http://wisdomgroup.com">WisdomGroup</a> turned twenty years old today. Whenever I experience outstanding service from a company, I pause to think about how to apply the lesson to WisdomGroup and all of our related ventures. The lesson in this case: Think ahead. Anticipate the needs of the customer. And fulfill those needs.</p>

<p>Thanks OWC for making the SSD upgrade process as seamless as possible. And thanks for the business lesson, too!</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/22/too-soon-for-alpha-centauri/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-22T12:07:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/22/too-soon-for-alpha-centauri</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bad news&#58; I have decided to cancel <a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a> for 2015. Ticket sales are insufficient to cover the cost of the event. Every person who bought a ticket will receive a full refund.</p>

<p>Barbados is a beautiful island nation with welcoming people, a university that leads in multiple technical areas, and a thriving economy. The RubyCaribe (pronounced ka-REEB) organizers will make the event happen in some form at some point in the future. Just not now.</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<h3>Alpha Centauri</h3>

<p>NASA has launched successful missions to the Moon, Mars, and other bodies in our solar system. NASA would like to visit Alpha Centauri, 4.4 light years away. But they will only launch an Alpha Centauri mission after key prerequisites (maybe the theoretical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive">Alcubierre drive</a>) are in place.</p>

<p>It’s too soon for Alpha Centauri, right now. But one day, humans will get there.</p>

<p>The RubyCaribe team has achieved eight years of success with <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a>, <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a>, and events focused on NoSQL and mobile technologies. With that track record, I believed that we could make RubyCaribe work in 2015. But reality disagrees with me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too soon for RubyCaribe, right now. But we will get there.</p>

<h3>Upside: LinuxBarbados</h3>

<p>While planning RubyCaribe, our team began an amazing relationship with the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill (<a href="http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/">UWI</a>). We collaborated with UWI to create <a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados</a>. The monthly LinuxBarbados meetings are an exciting way to grow your open source software and hardware skills. Discussions cover Linux, Parallella, Raspberry Pi, Ruby, Java&hellip; and more.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in Barbados, you can attend in person on the UWI campus. If you&rsquo;re not in Barbados, you can still participate because every LinuxBarbados meeting includes a live video conference. Sign up at <a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados.org</a> if you&rsquo;d like to know more.</p>

<h3>Next Steps for RubyCaribe</h3>

<p>Moving forward, our team will take an Alpha Centauri approach to RubyCaribe. We will get there. And we invite you to enjoy the journey with us.</p>

<p>Do you have thoughts about RubyCaribe? If so, you&rsquo;re welcome to <a href="http://RayHightower.com/contact">share via the contact form</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you like or dislike about RubyCaribe?</li>
<li>What do you think about the content?</li>
<li>What do you think about the price?</li>
<li>What do you think about the location?</li>
<li>Is there anything else you would like to share?</li>
</ul>


<p>Anonymous feedback is fine. Just put dummy values in the appropriate fields.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening. We look forward to seeing you at  <a href="http://chicagoruby.org">ChicagoRuby</a> and <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Git Vulnerability on Mac OS X and Windows]]></title>
    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/18/git-vulnerability-on-mac-os-x/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-18T17:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/12/18/git-vulnerability-on-mac-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> core team announced a security vulnerability and a corresponding fix. Hats off to the <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> team (yes, Mercurial!) for finding the problem. Hats off to the <code>Git</code> team for making the announcement, and for delivering a fix so quickly.</p>

<h3>What’s the Problem?</h3>

<p>If your Git installation remains un-patched, then a malicious person could over-write the <code>.git/config</code> directory in one of your repositories. This would allow them to alter your Git history and make changes in the repo without your knowledge. <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1853266">Details</a>.</p>

<p>The vulnerability exists on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. This article will discuss solving the problem on Mac OS X only, since that is my primary development platform.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Mac and Windows users are exposed because their file systems are not case-sensitive by default. Linux users who use a case-sensitive file system are protected. But Linux users might want to apply the patch anyway because (as stated by the Git core team):</p>

<blockquote><p>Even though the issue may not affect Linux users, if you are a hosting service whose users may fetch from your service to Windows or Mac OS X machines, you are strongly encouraged to update to protect such users who use existing versions of Git.
~Git Core Team</p></blockquote>

<h3>Is My Machine Vulnerable?</h3>

<p>I know that my machine was vulnerable because I was running an un-patched version of Git, as seen below.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p></p>

<h3>How to Upgrade</h3>

<p><a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/12/homebrew-fundamentals/">Homebrew</a> makes it easy to install and maintain Git. First, update Homebrew&hellip;</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<h3>Avoid Conflicts With Apple&rsquo;s Git</h3>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/kcocev">Kristjan Cocev</a> notes in the comments below, Mac OS X comes with its own Git installation. By the time you bought the machine, that pre-installed version is probably out of date. My pre-installed Git was:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>/usr/bin/git --version
</span><span class='line'>git version 1.9.3 <span class="o">(</span>Apple Git-50<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s pre-installed Git isn&rsquo;t bad, but here&rsquo;s the problem. Depending on how your <code>PATH</code> variable is setup, there might be a conflict between Apple-installed Git and the one you installed via Homebrew.</p>

<p>Here are two alternatives for fixing the conflict before it causes problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>Change your <code>PATH</code> variable so that Homebrew-installed Git is executed long before Apple-installed Git gets reached, OR&hellip;</li>
<li>Rename Apple-installed Git as follows:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo mv /usr/bin/git /usr/bin/git-apple
</span><span class='line'>Password:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>~<span class="nv">$ </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>So now, if you want to use Apple&rsquo;s pre-installed Git (unlikely) you can simply navigate to <code>/usr/bin/git-apple</code>.</p>

<h3>Open Source Rocks</h3>

<p>Again, hats off to everyone in the open source community who pulled together to make this fix happen!</p>

    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/10/30/chicagoruby-expands-to-north-shore</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Long-time observers of ChicagoRuby know that the group is always striving to achieve more. Latest move: ChicagoRuby is now hosting a monthly meetup on Chicago’s North Shore. The first meeting of ChicagoRuby: North Shore will be held on Saturday, December 6, 2014 at 10:30am. Visit <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/216193202/">Meetup.com</a> for details and to RSVP.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Why the North Shore?</h3>

<p>Why expand to Chicago’s North Shore? One reason: Several ChicagoRuby members live there, and travelling to meetings downtown and in Elmhurst can be quite a haul.</p>

<p>The bigger reason: Two members have stepped up to manage the north shore operation. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/61690512/">Doug Harman</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/members/13463131/">Stu Gerstein</a> have been active in Elmhurst for a long time. They were chosen as organizers because they are vocal and they have already done the preliminary leg work.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how we roll in ChicagoRuby. Many years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/ginnyhendry">Ginny Hendry</a> demonstrated that if you push for a new activity in ChicagoRuby (like hack nights) you might end up running it!</p>

<h3>Exciting Year</h3>

<p>2014 has proven to be an exciting year for ChicagoRuby. So far, the group has…</p>

<ul>
<li>Collaborated with the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill, Barbados to form <a href="http://linuxbarbados.org">LinuxBarbados</a>.</li>
<li>Built alliances with top-notch developers in multiple countries to create <a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a>.</li>
<li>Expanded the monthly Chicago-area activities to four per month.</li>
<li>Grown the organizer team to ten (10) members.</li>
</ul>


<p>Looking forward to more!</p>

I am grateful that the group invited me to present. Outline (prepared in advance):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>30 minutes: Overview of Ruby, Rails, and some alternatives to both. What are the advantages and disadvantages of building web apps with Ruby? Can you build a business with this stuff?</p></li>
<li><p>30 minutes: Questions and Answers. This will be a highly interactive time. Anything discussed earlier is fair game. We can explore technical specifics if you like.</p></li>
<li><p>60 minutes: Deep dive into anything the group wants to explore related to technology, business, or the combination of the two. If the group doesn&rsquo;t choose a topic, we will end early. But if the group is interested and engaged, we will continue.</p></li>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/09/10/manage-that-openrov-tether/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-10T18:40:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/09/10/manage-that-openrov-tether</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_tether_management_slip_ring.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV tether management, one way that works.' title='OpenROV tether management, one way that works.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV tether management, one way that works.</span></span>
<em>Note: This article has been updated with more photos and details describing slip ring installation.</em></p>

<p>Youthful exuberance drove me to pilot my <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a> before I built a good tether management system. Bad idea! It&rsquo;s better to have a tether management plan (any plan) before you pilot your OpenROV.</p>

<p>This article describes a tether management system that works for me. Other OpenROVers have devices that work, too. Take a look at a few and eventually you will find one that fits you.</p>

<h3>Off-the-Shelf Parts</h3>

<p>This tether management system is constructed entirely from off-the-shelf parts. The main component is an <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/KAB-Enterprise-Co-Ltd-20-ft-16-3-Cord-Reel-with-4-Outlets-CR002/100661463">extension cord reel sold by Home Depot</a> for about $14.00. Buy it, gut it, add the slip ring using three screws (also from Home Depot) and you’re good to go.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_lake_michigan.png' width='' height='' alt='Exploring Lake Michigan with OpenROV.' title='Exploring Lake Michigan with OpenROV.'><span class='caption-text'>Exploring Lake Michigan with OpenROV.</span></span></p>

<h3>Slip Ring</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/adafruit_slip_ring.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Adafruit slip ring.' title='Adafruit slip ring.'><span class='caption-text'>Adafruit slip ring.</span></span>
The slip ring is central to this solution. A slip ring allows an electrical spool to spin while electrical contacts remain intact. This slip ring was purchased from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/736?gclid=CJDMiPma1cACFQoEaQod1iwAFQ">Adafruit</a> for about $18.00.</p>

<h3>How to Install the Slip Ring</h3>

<p>First, pull the entire orange cable out of the extension cord reel. It would be great to keep the whole orange cable as part of the tether, but then we wouldn’t have room for the original tether (twisted pair). Cut the orange cable so that only one meter remains attached to the reel assembly.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_tether_management_internals.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Front view, back view, internal view.' title='Front view, back view, internal view.'><span class='caption-text'>Front view, back view, internal view.</span></span></p>

<p>Next, take the extension cord reel apart. Two phillips-head screws hold the device together. Remove the two screws, and the two orange disks will fall apart.</p>

<p>Now let’s focus on the disk without the electrical plugs. You will need to cut a hole in the exact center of this disk. The hole will need to be large enough to let the thicker part of the slip ring through, while allowing enough of an edge for the flange screws. The photos give a clearer picture than the words in this paragraph.</p>

<p>After you insert the slip ring, drill holes for the three slip ring mounting screws. One way to do this: Drill one hole first, insert the screw, tighten the nut, and then measure/drill the remaining holes. You’re more likely to align all of the holes correctly this way.</p>

<h3>Loctite Threadlocker</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/slip_ring_loctite.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Loctite oozing from the screws.' title='Loctite oozing from the screws.'><span class='caption-text'>Loctite oozing from the screws.</span></span>
<a href="http://www.loctiteproducts.com/threadlockers.shtml">Loctite</a> makes a threadlocker, a gummy substance that keeps screws from jiggling loose. They also make super glue; that&rsquo;s not what you want for this project. If you use Loctite&rsquo;s threadlocker on the slip ring screws, they will remain tight until you remove them on purpose.</p>

<h3>Connecting Inside the Reel</h3>

<p>Take a look inside the reel. You’ll see black, green, and white cables inside. You won’t need to do anything with the black cable. Splice the green line from the slip ring to the green line inside the reel, and splice the white slip ring line with the white reel line. Your technique may vary, but I used a combination hook splice, solder, hot glue, and heat shrink tubing. If you wear a belt and suspenders your pants will never fall down!</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_extra_tab.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Extra tab inside the reel, before and after removal.' title='Extra tab inside the reel, before and after removal.'><span class='caption-text'>Extra tab inside the reel, before and after removal.</span></span></p>

<h3>Gotcha: Removing the Extra Tab</h3>

<p>After initial assembly, I noticed that there was an extra tab inside of the reel. I don’t know the original purpose for the tab, but since it appeared to interfere with tether operation, it had to go. Wire clippers and a dremel tool made quick work of the tab. The before &amp; after photos tell the story.</p>

<h3>Attaching the Tether &amp; Topside Adapter</h3>

<p>Now that you have a functioning reel with a slip ring, attach the twisted pair tether to the 1-meter orange extension cable. Hook splice, solder, hot glue, and heat shrink did the trick for me.</p>

<p>The topside adapter can be attached to the top of the reel with Velcro, as shown in the photos throughout this article. Plug the green and white cables from the outer slip ring into the topside adapter, and you&rsquo;re ready to test the new tether management system.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/nanuk_935_openrov.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Nanuk 935 with OpenROV.' title='Nanuk 935 with OpenROV.'><span class='caption-text'>Nanuk 935 with OpenROV.</span></span>
What should we do with the slip ring&rsquo;s extra lines? I tied mine together for future use. I may cut them if I decide that they&rsquo;re not useful. If you have other ideas, feel free to post in the comments below.</p>

<h3>Everything Fits</h3>

<p>The new tether management system is small enough to share space with an OpenROV inside a <a href="http://nanukcase.com/productdetails.asp?node=205">Nanuk 935 case</a>. The Nanuk case has wheels, a foam interior, and it is rugged and small enough to fly as an airline carry-on.</p>

<p>Whip everything out and you&rsquo;re ready to explore.</p>

    <link href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/09/09/solar-powered-parallella/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-09T09:18:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/09/09/solar-powered-parallella</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella_solar.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Give solar power to your Parallella with a few simple components.' title='Give solar power to your Parallella with a few simple components.'><span class='caption-text'>Give solar power to your Parallella with a few simple components.</span></span></p>

<p>This article describes a simple hardware hack: Making the <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/07/07/parallella-quick-start-guide-with-gotchas/">Parallella</a> run on solar energy.</p>

<p>Motivation: The fastest computers in the world gulp electricity at an alarming rate. For example, <a href="http://www.top500.org/system/177999">Tianhe-2</a> at the National Super Computer Center in Guangzhou, China uses 17.8 megawatts of energy per year. In dollars, that’s roughly $17 million spent on electricity spent each year, depending on how the electricity is sourced.</p>

<p>Scientists at <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories</a> estimate that the earth&rsquo;s surface absorbs enough solar energy in ninety minutes to power every electrical device on the planet for a full year. A year&rsquo;s worth of energy in ninety minutes! Surely we can use some of that energy to power our supercomputers.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Observations</h3>

<p>The solar Parallella idea was driven by a few observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parallella only needs five watts of power, five volts at 1 ampere. The device might spike at startup or during heavy calculations, but not by much.</p></li>
<li><p>USB provides electrical power at five volts, typically less than 2 amperes.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell phone solar chargers are easy to find. These pocket-sized chargers provide power over USB.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Can a cell phone solar charger be hacked to power Parallella? Yes!</p>

<h3>Building the Hybrid Cable</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to get started&hellip;</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella_usb_solar.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Making the connections.' title='Making the connections.'><span class='caption-text'>Making the connections.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, get an off-the-shelf solar device capable of providing 5 volts at 2 amperes. Many cell phone solar chargers will do this, but some will only provide 1 ampere of current. You will need 2 amperes. As of this writing, Amazon sells solar cell phone chargers for about $35.00. Note that the model shown in this article combines a photovoltaic panel with a lithium ion battery. Energy provided by the sun can be stored by the battery for later use.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut open a USB cable to expose power (red), ground (black), and signal cables (green and white) as shown in the photo.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an old AC adapter cable that fits the Parallella power connection. Cut it open to expose the power and ground wires as shown in the photo.</p></li>
<li><p>Solder the USB power to the old adapter power wire, and USB ground to the adapter&rsquo;s ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover everything with heat shrink tubing or electrical tape. Heat shrink is preferred since it will last longer.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You&rsquo;re done! Plug everything in and watch your Parallella boot up. Note that this configuration will also power the Parallella&rsquo;s cooling fan.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/parallella_solar_complete.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Parallella running on solar power.' title='Parallella running on solar power.'><span class='caption-text'>Parallella running on solar power.</span></span></p>

<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>

<p>It probably doesn’t make sense to call this a project. It&rsquo;s more of a proof of concept. Scaling up will cost money and time. But the benefits of solar energy, including cost savings and reduced carbon footprint, make this a worthwhile path to pursue.</p>

<a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a> #1227 went for a spin in Lake Michigan this week. Success! Here are a few first-voyage observations:</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>The electronics chassis is truly waterproof. Same for the battery compartments. Waterproofing was my biggest concern during assembly. Hats off to the OpenROV team for an excellent set of assembly instructions.</li>
<li>Condensation builds up in the electronics chassis during operation. A quick review of the OpenROV forum tells me that I should add a desiccant bag to the compartment. Or pack the unit in low humidity.</li>
<li>The OpenROV is a little back-heavy. The back dips lower than the front during operation. I should add some weights to the front of the unit.</li>
<li><a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/09/10/manage-that-openrov-tether/">Tether management is a <em>must</em></a>. After one voyage (can you really call a
simple dip in the lake a voyage?) my OpenROV tether is a mess. Time to
build a way to manage the tether.</li>
</ul>


<p>What an exciting way to explore Node.js, BeagleBone Black, and the Maker Movement all at once.</p>

<h3>ESCs: New Experience for Me</h3>

<p>Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) were completely new to me when I first assembled my <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/06/16/citizen-science-with-openrov/">OpenROV</a>. This article documents my initial misunderstanding (and eventual understanding) of ESCs so that future builders can move forward with fewer glitches.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The photo at the top of this page shows an OpenROV controller board, a
BeagleBone Black, and three ESCs. This article will focus on the ESCs.</p>

<h3>Remember This About ESCs</h3>

<p>Until all three ESCs are programmed <em>and</em> calibrated, the OpenROV might behave erratically. For example&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>The servo that moves the camera up and down will not respond to keyboard commands.</li>
<li>When you turn one ESC switch on, an unrelated motor (or motors, plural) might start spinning. In my case, turning on one ESC (any of the three ESCs) caused two motors to spin.</li>
</ul>


<p>In my case, the programming was correct, but I <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/19/openrov-assembly-challenges/">dropped the ball on calibration</a>. And when the motors responded out-of-sync with the switches, I thought I had soldered some connections incorrectly. De-soldering and re-soldering connections would have been a ton of extra work, and that would not have solved the problem.</p>

<p>I reached out to the <a href="http://openrov.com/forum">forum</a> where OpenROV engineer Brian Adams pointed me in the right direction. Brian&rsquo;s diplomatic response could be summarized as <em>RTFM</em>. So I re-RTFM&rsquo;d, and it worked!</p>

<p>The bottom line: Do the ESC programming and calibration first. If the OpenROV misbehaves, re-check programming and calibration before considering other solutions.</p>

<h3>Why Use ESCs?</h3>

<p>Since ESCs require so many steps (programming and calibration) we might logically ask: <em>Why use ESCs at all?</em> Why not use simple analog motors without controllers and call it a day?</p>

<p>We use ESCs because the benefits outweigh the work required to configure them. It&rsquo;s all about control. By using an ESC to control each motor, we can use software to specify the <em>exact</em> number of RPMs and direction for each motor. We can make any motor (or combination or motors) start, stop, or change direction on a dime. Even better: When we move a lever on our controller of choice (keyboard, game controller, etc.) software on the OpenROV controller board decides the exact number of RPMs for each motor at that instant. OpenROV pilots don&rsquo;t need to think about this process while it happens. It just works.</p>

<p>The pilot&rsquo;s finger moves a controller lever. The lever position gets sent to software on the OpenROV controller board, and the controller board tells each ESC what its corresponding motor should do.</p>

<p>In summary, we use ESCs so that OpenROV pilots can have greater control over movement.</p>

<h3>How to Re-Check ESC Programming</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/esc_program_card.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC program card.' title='ESC program card.'><span class='caption-text'>ESC program card.</span></span>
Those of you with ESC experience already know about ESC program cards. I first learned about the cards while researching this problem. Amazing devices! Yes, it is possible to program ESCs using the series of button pushes and beeps in the OpenROV instructions. That&rsquo;s what I did, and it works. But a program card is faster. Amazon sells ESC program cards for less than fifteen dollars each. Well worth the investment, especially if you&rsquo;re programming ESCs for several OpenROVs.</p>

<h3>ESC Calibration Gotcha</h3>

<p>ESC calibration was tricky for me because turning on any of the three ESC switches caused two of my motors to spin: vertical and port. Further, since my electronics chassis was (mostly) assembled by the time I got to the calibration step, it wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to trace each power switch to its corresponding ESC.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I had to do.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_esc_switch_labels.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC switch labels.' title='ESC switch labels.'><span class='caption-text'>ESC switch labels.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>First, I took everything apart, while keeping the electronic leads (those which had already been soldered) intact. I needed to do this so I could see where each wire was going.</li>
<li>Next, I labeled the back of each ESC switch with its corresponding ESC number. I did not want to go through the disassembly step again! The Brother P-Touch label maker was perfect for this step.</li>
<li>Finally, I followed the ESC calibration steps <em>while ignoring the behavior of the motors</em>. For example, turning on ESC1 caused the motors connected to ESC1 (port) <em>and</em> ESC2 (vertical) to spin. I ignored the motors while plowing through OpenROV&rsquo;s written calibration steps.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Modified Calibration Steps</h3>

<p>Here are the OpenROV calibration steps, with slight tweaks based on my personal experience.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_calibration_sliders.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Click "Diagnostics" from the OpenROV cockpit.' title='Click "Diagnostics" from the OpenROV cockpit.'><span class='caption-text'>Click &ldquo;Diagnostics&rdquo; from the OpenROV cockpit.</span></span></p>

<ol>
<li>Each ESC switch has a red reset button. To turn the ESC on, move its slider switch toward the red reset button. The off position is in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>With all of the ESCs switched off, go ahead and power up the OpenROV. The motors should remain stationary at this point. Connect with the cockpit software and open the diagnostic pane.</li>
<li>Grab one ESC switch, and hold down its red reset button while powering it on. (At this point, two of my motors began spinning, V and P. I ignored the spinning motors while plowing through the rest of the steps.) You will hear a beeping noise. Let go of the reset button. (It will keep beeping which is fine). While it’s beeping, the red LED inside the corresponding ESC will flash in rhythm with the beeps.</li>
<li>Press reset once and you should hear a single beep. Move that motor&rsquo;s slider all the way to the right (or click the &ldquo;1&rdquo;) and then press the reset on the ESC again. You should get 2 beeps. The motor will not move during this step.</li>
<li>Move that motor&rsquo;s slider all the way to the left (or click the &ldquo;-1&rdquo;) and then press the reset on the ESC again. You will hear three beeps.</li>
<li>After a few seconds the motor will begin to spin. Switch off the ESC, and the motor will stop spinning.</li>
<li>Move the slider back to the middle (or click the &ldquo;0&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Repeat these steps with the next ESC until all three ESCs are done.</li>
</ol>


<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_lake_michigan_2.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.' title='OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV meets Lake Michigan.</span></span>
After calibration:</p>

<ul>
<li>With all three ESCs powered on, the motors remained stationary, as expected.</li>
<li>Each motor responded to the correct slider within the cockpit software&rsquo;s diagnostic pane.</li>
<li>The up/down servo for the camera responded correctly to the Q, A, and Z commands.</li>
<li>The motors responded to keyboard commands, as described within the cockpit&rsquo;s quick reference guide.</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words, calibration worked when I ignored the behavior of the motors while plowing through the steps.</p>

<h3>Success</h3>

<p>There is great satisfaction in solving an elusive problem. The OpenROV forum proved to be a powerful and useful resource. Next step: <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/22/openrov-meets-chicago-lake-michigan/">Piloting the OpenROV in Lake Michigan</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_rth.jpg' width='' height='' alt='OpenROV fully assembled.' title='OpenROV fully assembled.'><span class='caption-text'>OpenROV fully assembled.</span></span>
I know this problem can be solved. I just haven’t figured it out yet, and I need help from the <a href="http://openrov.com/">OpenROV</a> community to do so.</p>

<p><em>Update: The OpenROV community delivered. Solution: <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/21/esc-programming-and-calibration-for-openrov/">ESC Programming and Calibration for OpenROV</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Parts That Work</h3>

<p>Software image updates on the Beaglebone Black work flawlessly thanks to scripts written by <a href="https://github.com/BrianAdams">Brian Adams</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codewithpassion">Dominick Fretz</a>. The cockpit software shows a real-time image from the camera, the LED lights are super-bright, and the lasers hold steady at 10cm apart. My fully assembled OpenROV passes the water submersion test. Yes, it’s waterproof, thanks to O-rings and silicon-based lubricant!</p>

<p>What about the motors? The motors work, almost. Could it be the
electronic speed control (ESC) settings, calibration, or less than
perfect soldering? That&rsquo;s where I need help.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Summary of Symptoms</h3>

<p>With the cockpit software running and attached to the OpenROV:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I turn on any of the three ESCs, two of the motors (vertical and port) start running at full blast. The starboard motor remains stationary.</li>
<li>While the V and P motors continue to run at full blast, the starboard motor responds to the cockpit slider controls as expected: +1 makes S run full blast on one direction, -1 sends S full blast in the other direction, and 0 stops the S motor completely. During this exercise, V and P continue at full blast.</li>
<li>Turning off the ESC stops the V and P motors.</li>
<li>When I turn on any of the ESCs, the camera servo jumps slightly, about 10 degrees. And then the V and P motors run full blast.</li>
</ul>


<p>When the cockpit software is not running (and the Google Chrome browser is completely closed):</p>

<ul>
<li>Turning on an ESC has no effect on the motors.</li>
<li>The camera servo jumps slightly, about 10 degrees, as it did with the cockpit software running. But the motors remain stationary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Interesting behavior!</p>

<h3>Double-Checking the ESC Settings</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/esc_program_card.jpg' width='' height='' alt='ESC Program Card' title='ESC Program Card'><span class='caption-text'>ESC Program Card</span></span>
During troubleshooting, my first step was to double-check the electronic speed controller (ESC) settings. Setting the ESCs with the beep-and-button-push method was time consuming. And I was concerned that I may have made a mistake in counting the beeps.</p>

<p>Solution: I bought an ESC program card. Amazon sells them for less than fifteen dollars, well worth the price when you consider the peace of mind that the card brings. The program card shows each ESC setting with a clear 7-segment LED display, much easier than counting beeps!</p>

<p>According to the program card, all of the ESC settings are correct.</p>

<h3>Using a Power Supply Instead of Batteries</h3>

<p>All of the time spent troubleshooting drained the OpenROV batteries. So I devised a way to apply power directly to the OpenROV without batteries.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper middle'><img class='caption' src='http://RayHightower.com/images/openrov_power_supply.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Directly connected to power supply.' title='Directly connected to power supply.'><span class='caption-text'>Directly connected to power supply.</span></span></p>

<p>The photo reveals the random condition of my work surface, so here&rsquo;s a verbal description of this hack:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the background, a power supply set to 12 volts</li>
<li><code>+</code> lead (red) connected to the <code>+</code> leads of the battery containers, via a wire acting as a Y-connector.</li>
<li><code>-</code> lead (black) connected to a ground terminal on the OpenROV controller board through a black jumper cable</li>
</ul>


<p>I find that this hack works best if I connect the 12 volt setup first while the Topside Adapter is powered off. Applying power (via USB) to the Topside Adapter turns the entire assembly on.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this section and you know a better way for me to connect the power supply, please advise in the comments section below.</p>

<h3>Advice Welcome</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where to look next to solve the challenge with the motors. Maybe I skipped a step somewhere during assembly? Advice welcome!</p>

<p><em>Update: As noted at the beginning of this article, this problem has been solved. Solution: <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/08/21/esc-programming-and-calibration-for-openrov/">ESC Programming and Calibration for OpenROV</a>.</em></p>

Do you see yourself in any of these scenarios?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have already built a successful Rails app. Now that you&rsquo;re &ldquo;done&rdquo;, you know you can make it better, but you&rsquo;re not sure how. You want to take your skills to the next level.</p></li>
<li><p>You recently graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, <a href="http://thestarterleague.com">Starter League</a>, <a href="http://www.mobilemakers.co/">Mobile Makers</a> or another school. You&rsquo;re ready to meet and interact with your next generation of mentors.</p></li>
<li><p>You are no longer a beginner. You have seen <em>advanced</em> developers in action, and you are determined to get there yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Software development is relatively new to you, and you built a successful track record in another profession. You want to meet people who can help you accelerate through the beginner phase so you can launch something useful.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Common thread: It&rsquo;s time to unleash the awesomeness in your bones. You want to take your skills to the next level, and you are ready to tackle <em>Big League Problems</em>. <a href="http://windycityrails.org">WindyCityRails</a> is for you.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>What are Big League Problems?</h3>

<p>You might think of a big league problem as a good problem. For example, the Rails app you built is pulling in customers, and you&rsquo;re bumping into the limits of your software architecture. Who knew that so many people would buy from you?</p>

<p>Now&hellip; How do you scale? Do you buy more hardware, change your architecture, choose a new platform, or some combination of these? <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#williams">Dr. Nic Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#shirai">Brian Shirai</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#light">Evan Light</a>, <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#menard">Mark Menard</a> deal with scaling problems. Learn from them.</p>

<p>Maybe you built a gem to solve a problem for yourself, and now you want to release your gem to the world. What legal questions do you need to consider? Did Rails face similar challenges in the beginning? <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#saper">Daliah Saper</a> is an attorney who specializes in intellectual property and other open source software issues. Put her team to work for you.</p>

<p>How about security? Have you outgrown the <code>Devise</code> gem? Or do you simply need to know more about <code>Devise</code> internals so that you can use it more effectively? Maybe it&rsquo;s time to abandon username/password logins altogether and go with SQRL. <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#love">Justin Love</a> and <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/#mazza">Lucas Mazza</a> might have some ideas for you.</p>

<h3>Awesome Speakers. Awesome Audience.</h3>

<p>This year&rsquo;s WindyCityRails features the most powerful collection of speakers we&rsquo;ve ever assembled. Check out the <a href="http://www.windycityrails.org/schedule/">complete list of WindyCityRails speakers</a> and ask yourself what you can learn from each one.</p>

<p>Even better: Only 300 WindyCityRails tickets will be sold. Our speakers enjoy interacting with audience members throughout the conference. As professionals, they are always learning, too! So if you want some face time with people who understand Big League Problems (and more importantly, Big League Solutions) WindyCityRails is the place for you to be.</p>

<p>Therefore, it appeared that the Ubuntu/Linux <code>$PATH</code> variable was being ignored. Google led us to consider the shell in use on the Parallella.</p>

<h3>Which Shell Is In Use?</h3>

<p>The shell is just a program that lets humans talk to the Linux operating system through a command line interface. Several shell programs exist. Linux users tend to prefer one shell or another. The <code>$SHELL</code> environmental variable points to the one in use.</p>

<p>Very interesting. <code>tcsh</code> was the current Parallella shell. I&rsquo;m more accustomed to <code>bash</code>. Could RVM prefer <code>bash</code> too? We changed one line of <code>/etc/passwd</code> to tell the Parallella to start with <code>bash</code> instead of <code>tcsh</code> and rebooted the Parallella.</p>

<p>
&hellip;and now RVM works normally.</p>

<h3>Consider Fish?</h3>

<p>Right after this exercise, Zach and <a href="http://twitter.com/josh_cheek">Josh Cheek</a> had a Twitter conversation about a shell called <a href="http://fishshell.com/">fish</a>. Something new and shiny to explore!</p>

<h3>Original Plan: Rubinius</h3>

<p>Did I mention that we originally planned to install <a href="http://RayHightower.com/blog/2014/02/06/installing-rubinius-using-rvm/">Rubinius</a> on the Parallella? Where there are goals, there are yaks waiting to be shaved!</p>
